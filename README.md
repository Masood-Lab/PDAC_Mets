# Exploring Pancreatic Cancer Multicellular Ecosystems: A Spatially Resolved Transcriptomics Atlas of Matched Primary and Metastatic Samples.

## Abstract
###
Whereas spatial, cellular, and molecular features of human early-stage pancreatic cancer (PDAC) are well characterized, metastasis ecology remains elusive. By leveraging spatially resolved transcriptomics, we reveal underappreciated tissue dynamics and novel therapeutic vulnerabilities in matched primary and metastatic PDAC. Instead of identifying a clear distinction between primary and metastatic PDACs, we discover spatially organized fibrotic, metabolic, and immunosuppressive niches that are conserved but vary in enrichment between primaries and metastases, enabling tumor growth and survival. The spatially distinct, metastatic immune niches demonstrated both pro- and anti-tumor phenotypes within immune cells, illustrating an intrinsic "tug-of-war" between the tumor cells and the host immune system. Despite the fundamental roles of these diverse niches, substantial interpatient heterogeneity in niche architecture necessitates personalized ecological mapping to tailor therapy. We demonstrate proof-of-concept by aligning niche blueprints with a drug database to systematically match microenvironments with therapeutic vulnerabilities. By implementing patient-specific, niche-targeted combination therapies, this approach may offer a promising strategy for this lethal disease. This study provides comprehensive insights into PDAC metastatic biology, laying the groundwork for future work and therapeutic development.
