## Abstract
###
While spatial, cellular, and molecular landscape of resected pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) are well characterized, spatial metastasis ecology remains elusive. Using spatially resolved transcriptomics on matched primary and metastatic PDACs uncovered conserved fibrotic, metabolic, and immunosuppressive spatial ecotype continuum across anatomical regions. Although conserved, spatial ecotype enrichment differs between primary tumors and their metastasis, enabling growth and survival. A distinct immune ecotype enriched in metastases revealed pro- and anti-tumor immune phenotypes, highlighting an intrinsic “tug-of-war”. Though crucial for tumor growth, spatial ecotype enrichment differences necessitate personalized mapping in each patient’s unique microenvironment to allow tailored treatment. By conceptualizing PDAC as a heterogeneous ecosystem, we demonstrate proof-of-concept by aligning ecotype blueprints with a drug database to define therapeutic vulnerabilities for various ecotypes in both primary and metastatic tumors.  This work offers comprehensive insights into the metastatic biology of PDAC and will serve as a valuable resource for therapeutic development against this deadly malignancy.
